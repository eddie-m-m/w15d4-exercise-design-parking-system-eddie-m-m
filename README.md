# w15d4-exercise-design-parking-system

A simple OOP implementation of a parking system.

## Description

This exercise demonstrates the basic principles of object-oriented programming.
<br>
<br>
It includes ***inheritance*** whereby successive kinds of vehicles are created by extending classes.
<br>
<br>
***Encapsulation***, or the process of hiding data and providing a safe interface for accessing that data, was used to restrict direct modification of available parking slots and vehicle types. (Of course, Python has no built-in mechanism to enforce encapsulation. We rely upon the good will of our readers :) ).
<br>
<br>
***Polymorphism***, or differentiating functionality for varying use cases with tools like method overriding, was used to enable child classes to return data specific to the own needs.
